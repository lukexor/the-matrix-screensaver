# The Matrix Screensaver

This is a simple port of [The
Matrix](https://github.com/lukexor/pix-engine/blob/main/examples/matrix.rs)
example from my [PixEngine](https://github.com/lukexor/pix-engine) project to a
macOS screensaver.

There is a zipped binary in the `Releases` section for macOS Catalina 10.15 and
later. Simply download the version for your system, unzip it and open the
`thematrix.saver` file to install.

If you'd like to build it yourself, follow these steps:

- Install Xcode
- Download the source code and open `thematrix.xcodeproj` in Xcode
- Go to `Product ->  Build`
- Depending on your Xcode settings you may have a `Products` folder where you
  can find the `thematrix.saver` file. Right click and click `Show in Finder`
  then open it.
- If you don't have a `Products` folder, you may need to look in
  `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` to find the `thematrix.saver` file.
