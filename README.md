# The Matrix Screensaver

This is a simple port of [The
Matrix](https://github.com/lukexor/pix-engine/blob/main/examples/matrix.rs)
example from my [PixEngine](https://github.com/lukexor/pix-engine) project to a
macOS screensaver.

There is a single binary in the `Releases` section for macOS 10.15. Simply
download it and open it on macOS to install.
